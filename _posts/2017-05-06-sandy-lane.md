The first meet up was held in the Gower Peninsula in Wales, at a community called Sandy Lane. Eleven of the group members got together to stay in an eco-cottage and begin discussing the hopes for our shared future.

During the stay we visited a local community, Holtsfield, and talked at length with one of the residents there. We then spent the evening eating and drinking around a campfire, taking it in turns to voice our motivations for joining the project and put forward our projected, personal timeframes before beginning.
